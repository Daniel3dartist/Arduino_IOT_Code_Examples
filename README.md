# Arduino_IOT_Code_Examples

![image link]()

This project aims to share examples of **Arduino** and **IOT** code to the community.
To continue with the examples, we recommend using the free virtual circuit simulation platform [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com).

Create and test your first Arduino code following our "Hello Light" example. In this example you will control the state of an LED lamp.
